description: "King Coal is a 1917 novel by Upton Sinclair that describes the poor\
  \ working conditions in the coal mining industry in the western United States during\
  \ the 1910s, from the perspective of a single protagonist, Hal Warner. As in his\
  \ earlier work, The Jungle, Sinclair uses the novel to express his socialist viewpoint.\
  \ The book is based on the 1913-1914 Colorado coal strikes and written just after\
  \ the Ludlow massacre. The sequel to King Coal was posthumously published under\
  \ the title, The Coal War.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
